version	NetFlow export format version number
count	Number of flows exported in this packet (1-30)
sys_uptime	Current time in milliseconds since the export device booted
unix_secs	Current count of seconds since 0000 UTC 1970
unix_nsecs	Residual nanoseconds since 0000 UTC 1970
flow_sequence	Sequence counter of total flows seen
reserved	Unused (zero) bytes


srcaddr	Source IP address
dstaddr	Destination IP address
nexthop	IP address of next hop router
input	SNMP index of input interface
output	SNMP index of output interface
dPkts	Packets in the flow
dOctets	Total number of Layer 3 bytes in the packets of the flow
first	SysUptime at start of flow
last	SysUptime at the time the last packet of the flow was received
srcport	TCP/UDP source port number or equivalent
dstport	TCP/UDP destination port number or equivalent
pad1	Unused (zero) bytes
tcp_flags	Cumulative OR of TCP flags
prot	IP protocol type (for example, TCP = 6; UDP = 17)
tos	IP type of service (ToS)
src_as	Autonomous system number of the source, either origin or peer
dst_as	Autonomous system number of the destination, either origin or peer
src_mask	Source address prefix mask bits
dst_mask	Destination address prefix mask bits
flags	Flags indicating, among other things, what flows are invalid
router_sc	IP address of the router that is bypassed by the Catalyst 5000 series switch. This is the same address the router uses when it sends NetFlow export packets. This IP address is propagated to all switches bypassing the router through the FCP protocol.
