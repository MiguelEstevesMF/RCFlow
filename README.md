RCFlow
====

RCFlow is an academic project developed in 2008 at University of Minho, PT.
The application in here provides analysis and management of logs generated by other network traffic capturing tools, including Wireshark, Tcpdump and Netflow.
Additionally this program captures traffic as well using the JPcap library and Winpcap 4.0.1 daemon.
Note that this capturing feature has only been tested on Windows XP and may not work on more recent systems.

For more documentation and screeshots of the application see here: https://github.com/MiguelEstevesMF/RCFlow/blob/master/doc/relatorio.pdf.
Please try out the application using the iso file in here: https://github.com/MiguelEstevesMF/RCFlow/blob/master/iso/RCFlow.iso.
To test the application use the logs in here: https://github.com/MiguelEstevesMF/RCFlow/tree/master/logs.

The code provided in here may be of help for whom is about to develop a similar program or is just curious about network traffic protocols.
